# Strict CSP
This WordPress plugin enables strict CSP (report mode) in the WordPress admin area.

It was used for testing purposes while introducing the changes that will make WordPress strict CSP-compatible in future versions:
* New APIs: https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/591
* Script tags refactoring: https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/498
* Inline event handlers and javascript: URIs refactoring: https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/551
